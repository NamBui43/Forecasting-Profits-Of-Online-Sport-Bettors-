# Forecasting Profits of Online Sports Bettors
Final Project for CS-C3240 Machine Learning D at Aalto University.

## Introduction
I am a huge fan of sports and sports betting, especially when it comes to football. Therefore, for the final project of CS-C3240 Machine Learning D at Aalto University, I want to dive deeper into this area of interest and explore it from a different perspective; this time not as a bettor, but as an data analyst. 

The objective of this project is to formulate and compare the efficiency of machine learning models that closely predict the profits of online sport bettors based on their gambling volume and tendency. 
The project has a very specific business application which is to help bwin Interactive Entertainment (bwin), an online betting agency, effectively classify their customers based on their predicted profits, thereby developing specialized customer strategies and targeted measures.  

## Data Description and Problem Analysis
The dataset used in this project comes from the collaborative Internet gambling research project between the Division of Addictions (DOA) and Bwin Interactive Entertainment (bwin), and was obtained from thetransparencyproject.org (title: Population Trends in Internet Sports Gambling).
The dataset initially contains 46,339 datapoints, which represent the demographic and sport betting records of 46,339 users on bwinâ€™s website throughout 18 months of the research (01.02.2005 - 31.08.2006). Originally, there are 21 features available for each datapoint, representing specific demographic and sport betting information of users. 
  
## Modelling
Random Forest Regression and Polynomial Regression were used.
The performances of the 2 models were compared to determine the superior option.

## Requirments
The code for this project was written in Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib

## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file.
